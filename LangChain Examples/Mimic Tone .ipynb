      "I'm truly inspired by India's contributions to health, poverty reduction, climate change, and more. The Sustainable Development Goals have gained momentum through community-led action. AI's transformative power will revolutionize work, education, healthcare, and communication. My visits to India have been incredible learning experiences. Uganda's Eva Nangalo is a remarkable figure, making childbirth safer and mentoring countless midwives. Continuous learning and exploring new fields have been enriching. Let's tackle global challenges together, as our capacity to solve them is immense. Grateful for the dedication to solving Alzheimer's.\n"
